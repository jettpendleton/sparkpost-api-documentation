# SparkPost API Documentation

[![Run in Postman](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static/run-button.png)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/81ee1dd2790d7952b76a)

## Prerequisites

* You have installed [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your development machine
* You have installed [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) on your development machine

The SparkPost API Docs in Apiary Blueprint format (based on Markdown)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/SparkPost/sparkpost-api-documentation```

2. Change into the directory

2. We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for our task runner, so you will also have to install Grunt globally

```npm install -g grunt-cli```

3. Install the dependencies

```npm install```

## Development

### Grunt Commands

#### Apiary Blueprint Validator

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can execute the Apiary Blueprint Validator tests in the following ways:

* Run the test on ALL /services/ files sequentially
  ```grunt testFiles```

* Run the test an individual /services/ file
  ```grunt shell:test:<filename>```

#### Compile and Test

* Concatenate ALL /services/ files into a single apiary.apib file, then test the compiled file
  ```grunt compile```

#### Static Docs Development Workflow

You can use `grunt staticPreview` to generate API docs under `static/` and start an auto-regen watch process.

*Note: the output of this command is not identical to production renders. Its intended as a usable preview for development work.*

### Deploying

The API documentation lives at https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/. When a commit is made to the `master` branch of this repo, it triggers a Travis CI run that executes the code in `bin/copy-to-devhub.sh`. The workflow is as follows:

* Clone the develop branch of the [SparkPost/sparkpost.github.io](https://github.com/SparkPost/sparkpost.github.io) repo
* Generate the HTML files for the API docs into `sparkpost.gitub.io/_api`
* Commit the changes, which triggers a Travis CI build for the `sparkpost.github.io` repo
